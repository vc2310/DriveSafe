# DriveSafe

It is a Desktop application made to guide the US citizens through a safer and secure route. This application takes a dataset of previous traffic violations. The dataset incorporates the coordinates of various traffic violations all over the country. Then, combined with Google maps, it would provide the user with a route avoiding most traffic violations ( the coordinates from the dataset). Besides, adding another feature, this likewise enables the user to get the traffic violations at a specific place as it will pin the coordinates with previous offences.

In order to run this application, run "MainApp.java" under the "src -> app". Also, make sure that the CSV file is present in the data directory.

Thank You and DriveSafe
